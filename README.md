# Farm Game
_Blair's repo for Farm Game._

**Includes:** 

1. Game source files
2. Custom Scripts made by hand
4. Basic Unity Scripts and Assets
5. Custom Assets
3. [MIT License](license.txt)



## Getting Started

1. This repo is not for download + play, this repo is simply for viewing and modding the original game code.
2. Download .ZIP and extract
3. "Add" Project to Unity


# IMPORTANT NOTE
**Unity project _must be on the same folder level as the `.gitignore` and `.gitattributes` files_. Failing to do so will cause unintended tracking and will more than likely attempt to commit _all_ of your changes since the `.gitignore` file will not be obeyed. Only move files around under extreme caution and knowledge.**
